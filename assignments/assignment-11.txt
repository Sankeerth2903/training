1. create two tables
	- products
		- product_id (pk), product_name, description, price, catgeory_id(fk)
		  (number)	   varchar2(300) varchar2(500) number number
	- categories
		- category_id(pk), category_name
		  (number)		(varchar2(20))

2. fetch records from products table into a Java application
	you have to write a query to fetch category_name along with how many products are there for each category \
	records should be sorted by category_name
	Note: if there is no product for any category, 0 should be displayed

	select...
	
	query result:
	-----------------------------------
	category_name  product_count
	book		2
	laptop		2
	mobile		2
	stationary	0

	JDBC application:
	category name   no of products
	----------------------------------
	book		2
	laptop		2
	mobile		2
	stationary	0

	on the JDBC application all settings (except properties file path) will be placed inside a properties file
	read the configuration from properties file
