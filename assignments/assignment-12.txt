create a Java s/w which helps you to write/log exception details in a file
	
	project/application-name: loggerapp
	package-name: com.java.logger
	a. create a class with a method to write/ log exception details of your application into a text file
	this class should follow singleton pattern (i.e. only one instance of this will be created in entrie application)
	b. create a class with a method to write/ log exception details of your application into a database table
	this class also should follow singleton pattern (i.e. only one instance of this will be created in entrie application)

	Note: both the classes should have same method for writing

	details of exceptions to be written in file and in a database table:
	a. exception class name, 
	b. exception message, 
	c. type of severity of the exception (minor, major, critical), 
	d. the name of the class where exception occurred, 
	e. the name of the method where exception has occurred, 
	f. date and time when that exception occurred

	project/application-name: ioccontainerapp
	package-name: com.java.ioccontainer
	this application will contain a dependency injector class with singleton pattern
	this class will have method to create instance of any class given the class metadata


	project/application-name: clientapp
	package-name: com.java.client
	in this application whatever code you choose to write should provide exception handling
	the exceptions now must be logged from this application
	Use that logger classes to log the exception details in a file or database, depending on the user choice
	the instance of any logger class should be created using dependency injection
