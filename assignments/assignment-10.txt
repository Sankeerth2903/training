create a Java application for calculation:
	A. 
	i. create an interface with declaration of two methods: add and subtract
	both the methods accept exactly two arguments of type integer and returns an integer

	ii. create a class (calculation) to implement the interface and the two methods
	iii. call those methods of the class from the main method

	B. 
	i. Now, add two more extra methods multiply and divide in the class without changing the source code of the class.
	both the methods accept exactly two arguments of type integer and returns an integer
	ii. call those extra two methods of the class from the main method, too
