Create a Java application to filter values from an array or list of integers
	filtration logic: it could be anything
	example:
	filter all even numbers from the list/array or 
	odd numbers from the list/array or 
	number greater than five etc.


1. create a List/Array of numbers and store some numbers in it
2. you have to create another static method (say, filter) after/before main method
	i. call the method from main and pass the list/array
	ii. the method must now filter all even numbers from the list/array
	Note: 
	*do not use any built-in method of the collection to filter the collection. 
	**do not write any logic for filtration inside that method. 
	***Pass the logic as 2nd argument to this filter method.
		A. use for/foreach loop to iterate the input array/list.
		B. add the numbers which satisfy the filtration logic in an another list/array
		C. return the resultant array/list
	ii. the method must return another list/array containing those even numbers only
3. in the main method just print the values from the collection return by that method

B. you have convert non-generic Functional Interface to generic functional interface
C. do not use the class which contains several methods matching to the functional interface methods
rather in the main method use lmbda function/expression to write your logic and pass that anonymous method to the functional interface variable
