employee entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double

	c. save every instance of employee in an array
	d. iterate through the array and calculate salary of every instance and print the same

Note: 
*: the class containing main method and the class for employee should be present in different packages in the application
**: every data member must have getter and setter.
***: the class must have default and parameterized constructor


array object storing:

A[] arr = new A[2];
arr[0] = new A();
arr[1] = new A();

int[] arr = new int[2];
