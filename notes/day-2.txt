OOP in Java:

class and object
how to create class in Java
members of class
access specifiers
constructor in Java
writing method in class
getter and setter

class: blueprint for object(s)

chasis_number, body_color, no_of_gears, mode_of_tranmission, seating_capacity, make_year, company_name, model_name etc.
start, stop, break, accelrate etc.

class Car{
	String chasisNumber;
	String bodyColor;
	int noOfGears;
	String modeOfTransmission;
	int seatingCapacity;
	short makeYear;
	String companyName;
	String modelName;

	start(){}
	stop(){}
	applyBreak(){}
	acclerate(){}
}

Car creta = new Car();
creta.chasisNumber="ahxp1234";
creta.modelName = "Creta";
creta.noOfGears = 5;
....................

creta.start();
creta.stop();

constructor:
	a special method inside class with name same as that of the class name
	no explicit return type, as they do not return anything with return statement
	they are invoked in order to initialize data members of that class and that class ONLY
		- default (or parameterless) constructor assigns default values to the data members
		- parameterized constructor(s) assigns user values to the data members
	constructor(s) is/are called/invoked during object creation, not after the object creation
	Note: constructor IS NOT RESPONSIBLE for creating object, it just initializes data members of the class

stack memory area: local variables of main and other methods
heap memory area: object memory allocation

int x = 100;
int* a = &x;
a++;

Car c = null;
c = new Car();
c++;//not possible

pointer vs reference:
pointer variable stores raw memory address
reference variable does store reference to the instance in the heap

you can do pointer arithmetic but not reference arithmetic
references can be used just to access the object region in the heap. the address/reference is subject to updation if the object is moved from one place in heap to another. but the updation happens behind the scence.


access specifiers for class: public (and private)
access specifiers for class members: public and private and protected


primitive type:
value type variable:a variable which stores value directly in the memory block

non-primitive type:
reference type variable: a variable which stores reference to an object/instance in the memory block. The object memory allocation is in the heap.


inheritance:
when any of the child class constructor is invoked, always base class's default constructor gets invoked
But, you can invoke parameterized constructor(s) of the base class from the child class constructor explicitlty, using "super" keyword

Note: single and multi-level inheritances are supported in Java, NOT multiple inheritance
class A {
	public void foo(){}
}
class C extends A {
	//public void foo(){}
	public void fooC(){}
}
class B extends A{
	//public void foo(){}
	public void fooB(){}
}

C objC = null;
objC = new C();
objC.foo();
objC.fooC();

B objB = new B();
objB.foo();
objB.fooB();

//a reference variable of base class, can store reference of its any  child class instance/object
=> up-casting (implicit conversion)
A obj1 = new B()/new C();
obj1.foo();

//down-casting: assigning a reference variable of child class with a reference  as stored in a reference variable of base type (explicit conversion)
C obj2 = null;
obj2 = (C)obj1;


//implicit conversion
int x = 1234;
long l = x;

//explicit conversion
long l = 12345678901; //1010101011010101111
int x = (int)l;
