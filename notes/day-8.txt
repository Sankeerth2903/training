1. how to create custom exception class
	- handle situation in your application, where JVM does not throw any exception
	- in layered architecture application for exception wrapping and propagating (funnelling and tunneling technique)
2. exception propagation in layered application

3. reflection:

	mechanism to examine any type during runtime or we can modify the bevahior of the type during runtime

	Class: java.lang
	provides several methods to extract metadata (of type, the members of the type), create instance etc.

	Field, Parameter, Method, Constructor: java.lang.reflect 

	what you can do using Reflection?
		extract information about data type(s)
		create instance of the class on the fly (dynamically) using that extracted metadata
		call method(s) of the class using extracted metadata of the method(s)

	Obtain any type Information:
		Class c = Class.forName("Person");
		
		Person instance  = new Person();
		Class c = instance.getClass();

		Class c = Person.class;
